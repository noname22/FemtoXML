FemtoXML_CPP Change Log
0.97 (14/08/2009)
	* Updated Element to be more C++-ish (conversions to int, double and string)

	* Added valueOf-method to Element, primarily to provide a shorthand for getting attribute values

0.96 (01/05/2008)

	  compatibility issues with throwing exceptions in a shared 
	  library and trying to catch them in an application)
	* Corrected documentation (FemtoXML)

0.95 (02/09/2008)
	* Added support for loading from a string
	* Major parsing performance increase (FemtoXML)
